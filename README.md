## Installation

To run the chatbot locally, follow these steps:

1. Colab Link to notebook: https://github.com/Chamindu77/Task-ChatBot.git](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tPsMeyjbA8yc0ZCXhH3hQwDB5VFi7b66#scrollTo=17a01fHxIFYD
2. Interact with the chatbot by typing your queries and receiving responses.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset used for fine-tuning the pre-trained model underwent preprocessing to ensure quality and relevance. Steps involved in data preprocessing include:

- Data cleaning
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization
- Removing stopwords
- Data augmentation (if applicable)

## Model Implementation

The chatbot utilizes a pre-trained model as its foundation, which was further fine-tuned using the provided dataset. Model implementation includes:

- Loading the pre-trained model
- Fine-tuning the model with the dataset
- Saving the fine-tuned model for deployment

## Model Evaluation

The chatbot's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

The evaluation process helps assess the chatbot's effectiveness in handling user queries and providing accurate responses.
